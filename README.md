## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>



This project is the continuation of [allpoetryapi](https://github.com/jmbhughes/allpoetryapi) project from [@jmbhughes](https://github.com/jmbhughes). I simply clean up the code and updated some parts that were broken. I also changed the project structure, and added utilities functions.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [usage](#usage) for notes on how to use the package.

### Prerequisites

**allpoetry** requires scraping libraries to work.

* `requests`
* `beautiful soup 4`
* `lxml`
* `re`
* `dateutil`

### Installing

To install the package, simply clone the repository and execute the `setup.py`.

```
git clone https://github.com/arthurdjn/allpoetry
cd allpoetry
pip install .
```


## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Follow these notes to work with **allpoetry** package.

### API

Connect to the python API to send your requests, and get the appropriate response. 

```python
from allpoetry import AllPoetry

# Optional, but recommended
USERNAME = "your_username"
PASSWORD = "your_password"

api = AllPoetry(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
```

### Retrieve a specific Poem

Retrieve a **poem** from its `url`.

```python

print(poem)
```

```

‚ÄúI am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.
Whatever I see I swallow immediately
Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.
I am not cruel, only truthful
The eye of a little god, four cornered.
Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.
It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long
I think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.
Faces and darkness separate us over and over.

Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,
Searching my reaches for what she really is.
Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.
I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.
She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.
I am important to her. She comes and goes.
Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman
Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.‚Äù

### Retrieve all Poems

You can of course retrieve all poems corresponding to an author.

The `top_k` parameter is used to control the number of retrieved poems. If provided, you will get maximum `top_k` poems otherwise all poems will be returned.

author = api.get_author(AUTHOR_NAME)

### Save your Poems

To save your poems, you can simply use `pickle`, a standard package for writing / loading binary files.

```python
with open(f"{AUTHOR_NAME}.pkl", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(poems, file)
```
